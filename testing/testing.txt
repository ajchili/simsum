Introduction

Tesseract is an open source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Engine, available under
the Apache 2.0 license. It can be used directly, or (for programmers) using an API to extract
typed, handwritten or printed text from images. It supports a wide variety of languages.

Tesseract doesn't have a built-in GUI, but there are several available from the 3rdParty
page.

Installation

There are two parts to install, the engine itself, and the training data for a language.

Linux

Tesseract is available directly from many Linux distributions. The package is generally called
'tesseract' or 'tesseract-ocr' - search your distribution's repositories to find it. Packages are
also generally available for language training data (search the repositories,) but if not you
will need to download the appropriate training data (=< 3.02 or the latest from github.com),
unpack it, and copy the .traineddata file into the 'tessdata' directory, probably

lusr/sha re/tesseractâ€”oc r/tessdata or /us r/sha re/tessdata .

If Tesseract isn't available for your distribution, or you want to use a newer version than they
offer, you can compile your own. Note that older versions of Tesseract only supported
processing .tiff files.
